This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is an example of 'useLayoutEffect' React hook. This code shows a tooltip under a button if there is no place to show the tooltip above. Actually this variant also works well with useEffect.

P.S. I think I should create some other example that actually shows benefits of using 'useLayoutEffect'.
